# Pre-Commit Review

When asked to review code before committing, perform the following steps:

## 1. Gather Change Information

1. Run `git status --short` to see all changed files (staged and unstaged).
2. Run `git diff --cached` to review staged changes.
3. If there are unstaged changes, also run `git diff` to review them.
4. For new untracked files, read those files directly.

## 2. Bug Check

Review every changed line for:

- **Undefined variables / name errors**: references to variables, functions, or classes that don't exist or aren't imported.
- **Type mismatches**: function calls with wrong argument types or mismatched shapes in PyTorch tensor operations.
- **Missing imports**: any symbol used but not imported; check the existing imports in the file.
- **API misuse**: incorrect usage of PyTorch / transformer_engine APIs (e.g., wrong argument names, missing required arguments, deprecated APIs).
- **Device / dtype issues**: tensors on wrong device or with wrong dtype, especially `.to(device)` or `.cuda()` calls that should be NPU-aware (`npu()`).
- **Async / sync bugs**: missing `.wait()`, `.synchronize()`, or incorrect stream handling.
- **Resource leaks**: opened files, streams, or handles not properly closed.
- **Error handling**: bare `except:`, overly broad `except Exception`, missing `finally` for cleanup.
- **Race conditions**: shared state without synchronization in multi-stream or multi-process code.
- **Off-by-one / boundary errors**: loop bounds, slice indices, tensor shape mismatches.
- **Hardcoded NPU-specific values**: paths, device IDs, or constants that should be configurable.

## 3. Optimization Check

Review changed code for:

- **Redundant operations**: unnecessary `.clone()`, `.detach()`, or repeated tensor-to-device transfers.
- **In-place opportunity**: operations that could use in-place variants (`.add_()` vs `.add()`) to reduce memory.
- **Recomputation vs memory tradeoff**: operations that are recomputed but could be cached, or vice versa.
- **Unnecessary Python loops**: loops over tensor elements that could be vectorized with PyTorch operations.
- **Gradient computation**: tensors that don't need gradients but have `requires_grad=True`.
- **Sequential vs fused ops**: multiple sequential operations that could be fused (e.g., `scale + add` instead of separate ops).
- **Unused computation**: variables computed but never used.
- **Import optimization**: unused imports or imports that could be deferred to reduce startup time.
- **NPU-specific optimization**: operations that could use NPU-specific kernels or avoid host-device synchronization.

## 4. Missed Modification Check

- **Incomplete refactoring**: old function/variable names still referenced after renaming.
- **Missing stubs**: new public functions/classes without corresponding `__init__.py` exports.
- **Missing test coverage**: new functionality without corresponding test changes.
- **TODO / FIXME / HACK left in code**: markers left behind that should be addressed.
- **Debug code**: left-in `print()`, `breakpoint()`, or debug assertions.
- **Missing type hints**: public APIs without type annotations when the project convention uses them.
- **Forgotten files**: `__pycache__/`, `.pyc`, `.o`, or other build artifacts that should be in `.gitignore`.
- **Inconsistent naming**: naming that doesn't follow project conventions (snake_case for Python, etc.).
- **Missing copyright headers**: new files without the project's standard copyright header.
- **Skeleton / placeholder code**: `pass`, `raise NotImplementedError`, or `...` left in place unintentionally.

## 5. Report

Summarize findings grouped by category. For each issue, include the file path, line number, and a concrete suggestion. Prioritize by severity: **BUG** > **Optimization** > **Missed Modifications**.

**Language**: Output the report in Chinese (中文) by default. The summary statistics, section headings, BUG / Optimization / Missed Modifications entries, file paths, line numbers, and concrete fix suggestions should all be written in Chinese. Code identifiers, file names, line numbers, and English-only technical terms (e.g. `Linear`, `forward_dw`, `quantize_weight`, `fsdp_group`) may be kept as-is in their original form.
